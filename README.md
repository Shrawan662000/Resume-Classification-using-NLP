# Resume-Classification-using-NLP
The ultimate goal is to build a user-friendly web application that takes a resume as input and classifies it into the appropriate job category. The project's significance lies in its potential to automate the initial screening of resumes and reduce the time and effort required by recruiters and employers to shortlist candidates, thereby streamlining the recruitment process.
The project on Resume classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various classification algorithms aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify resumes based on job requirements. This involves analyzing the textual data present in resumes, extracting relevant information, and preprocessing the data using NLP techniques like stopwords removal, tokenization, and stemming. Several classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Trees, are implemented and evaluated to choose the best-performing model.
